# **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning Guide for `food_coded.csv`**

## **1. Loading the Dataset**

First, the dataset is loaded using the pandas library. The CSV file is read and stored in a DataFrame named `df`.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('/content/food_coded.csv')
```

## **2. Understanding the Data**

Understanding the structure and content of the dataset is essential for effective preprocessing.

### **a. Display Dataset Information**
The `info()` method provides an overview of the dataset, showing the data types and the number of non-null values.

```python
print(df.info())
```

### **b. Display First Few Rows**
To get a quick glance at the dataset, use the `head()` method.

```python
print(df.head())
```

### **c. Statistical Summary**
The `describe()` method is useful for generating descriptive statistics for numerical columns.

```python
print(df.describe())
```

## **3. Handling Missing Values**

### **a. Identifying Missing Values**

It's essential to identify which columns have missing values and how many are missing in each column. The `isnull().sum()` method is used for this purpose.

```python
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

### **b. Strategy for Handling Missing Data**

After identifying the missing values, the next step is to decide on a strategy for handling them.

#### **i. Dropping Rows or Columns**

You can choose to drop rows or entire columns that contain missing values.

- **Drop Rows with Missing Values**

```python
df.dropna()
```

- **Drop Specific Columns**

In this example, the `type_sports` column is dropped.

```python
df = df.drop(columns=['type_sports'])
```

#### **ii. Imputing Missing Values**

Imputation involves replacing missing data with substituted values. Common strategies include mean, median, or mode imputation.

1. **Convert Non-Numeric to Numeric**
   For certain columns, converting non-numeric data to numeric is necessary. In this case, the `weight` column is converted to numeric values, with invalid parsing set to NaN.

```python
df['weight'] = pd.to_numeric(df['weight'], errors='coerce')
```

2. **Mean Imputation**
   Missing values in the `weight` column are filled with the mean of the column.

```python
df['weight'].fillna(df['weight'].mean(), inplace=True)
```

3. **Mode Imputation**
   Alternatively, missing values can be filled using the mode (most frequent value).

```python
df['weight'].fillna(df['weight'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
```

### **Final Cleaned Data**
After completing the imputation and handling of missing data, the cleaned DataFrame is ready for further analysis.

```python
print(df)
```
